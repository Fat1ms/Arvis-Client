## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Settings Dialog UI (`src/gui/settings_dialog.py`)

**Added Components:**
- TTS Engine Selector QComboBox with Silero/Bark options
- "?" Info button with Bark setup instructions
- Dynamic voice list filtering based on engine selection
- Engine labels showing language support

**Voice Map Example:**
```python
{
    "silero": [
        ("aidar", "[Silero] aidar — Russian (male)"),
        ("xenia", "[Silero] xenia — Russian (female)"),
        ("ru_v3", "[Silero] ru_v3 — Russian (universal)"),
    ],
    "bark": [
        ("v2/en_speaker_0", "[Bark] en_speaker_0 — English (male)"),
        ("v2/multilingual_00", "[Bark] multilingual_00 — мультиязык (RU/UK/EN)"),
        ("v2/multilingual_01", "[Bark] multilingual_01 — мультиязык (RU/UK/EN)"),
    ]
}
```

### 2. Engine Methods (modules)

All engines now support:
```python
def set_mode(self, mode: str) -> None
def set_enabled(self, enabled: bool) -> None
```

### 3. Dependencies Resolved

**omegaconf (2.3.0)**
- Required by Silero TTS subprocess worker
- Handles config parsing in subprocess
- Status: ✅ Installed and verified

**bark-ml**
- Python wrapper for Bark TTS
- Status: ✅ Installed and verified
- Version: ~0.2.13 (latest)

## 📝 Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `src/gui/settings_dialog.py` - TTS engine selector + voice filtering
- `modules/silero_tts_engine.py` - Added set_mode(), set_enabled()
- `modules/bark_tts_engine.py` - Added methods, updated voices
- `modules/tts_base.py` - Added base method signatures
- `src/gui/main_window.py` - Safe settings update

### Created
- `test_bark_tts.py` - Bark availability test
- `test_tts_simple.py` - TTS system validation suite
- `docs/BARK_TTS_SETUP.md` - Setup and usage guide (updated)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Bark Synthesis Speed**: Slower than Silero (5-30s vs <1s)
   - Mitigated by GPU support (CUDA)
   - Acceptable for offline/non-realtime use

2. **Bark Russian Quality**: Multilingual mode experimental
   - English quality higher
   - Fallback to Silero recommended for Russian

3. **Model Download Size**: ~3GB for Bark models
   - One-time download on first use
   - Can take several minutes

---

## ✅ Next Steps

### For Users
1. Open Arvis Settings → TTS | STT tab
2. Select preferred engine (Bark for quality, Silero for speed)
3. Choose voice from dropdown
4. Click Save
5. Test by generating LLM response + requesting TTS playback

### For Developers
1. Bark setup can be optional (document as advanced feature)
2. Consider adding TTS preview button in settings
3. Add language selection for auto-engine switching
4. Consider adding Bark voice cloning support (future)
